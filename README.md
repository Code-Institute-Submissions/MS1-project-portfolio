## Inspiration


I got a lot of inspiration from Apple's website as I wanted it very clean just like their website. I was also in other people's portfolios and checked a bit how they had done on their websites. but mostly it was to google around on pages I like and see how they did.

# UX


I chose to make a portfolio as my first project in this course as a basis in order to build my brand outwards when I apply for a job. My target group is primarily recruiters and future employers. 
I want to demonstrate my strengths' in programming as well as an idea of who I am as a person to facilitate my target group's quest for a future employee.

# Features

## Existing Features

* Feature 1 - A navigation bar for users so they can navigate throw the page nice and smooth.
* Feature 2 - A skills section for recruiters so they easy can get a picture of what i can.
* Feature 3 - Project section that links to my projects.
* Feature 4 - Timeline and contact section that also show recruiters what i have done before and how to get in touch with me. 
* Feature 5 - A contactform for people to contact me.
* Feature 6 - Footer with social media links and a link to download my resume.

## Feature ideas to Implement

* I have an idea of makeing a nicer frontpage header with js
* The project section i wan't to do like a carusell thing so the pictures are much bigger and to add text on the pictures. This also whit js.
* Fix the submit button so the form works.

# Screenshots

This is a picture before my first mentor call my code were broken and things weren't were its supposed to be. 

1. At first i had a grayscale on my background pic whitch looks nicer whitout.
2. Several parts was "broken" in terms of alignment, mostly on mobile and tablets.
3. I had alot of problems with the navigation bar, it broke on mobile and tablets. 
4. In the beginning i didnÂ´t use boostrap so much and i became a problem further in the project.

This are pictures when im almost finished. 

1. First i choosed to have the background picture cover the whole front page. Then i took away the grayscale becuse it looks more nice without it.
2. I fixed the broken parts mostly the navbar so it fits mobile and tablets. I used media Querys to solve most problems with the navbar and profilepicture. then i started to use bootstraps "row" and "col" to solve the alignment issues i had on the page.

# Testing

### My methods for testing my webpage consisted of:

* Using the inspector tool to test if the page was responsive on serveral different devices. 
* Having other people around me try to navigate the page and look for bugs that I didn't catch myself.
* Code validator.
* In the future I plan to implement automated tests.

My UX goals was to create a website that displayed my programming strengths' and personality to my target group (recruiters and future employers). 

* I believe by creating a well-working and aesthetic website my target group can see my strength in the frontend department. Later when I have backend projects to use in the "projects" section, I can also provide a showcase of strengths' in the backend department.

* I try to present my personality via the section called "My background" which contains a timeline of my previous workplaces and what I have studied before. Another section is called "Contact" which goes more in depth and has a little less formal tone.

### Here is some examples of bugs that I encounterd during testing:

* After trying to implement a responsive page, I didn't get the navigation bar to work correctly on smaller devices.
1. When viewing the page on mobile or a tablet, the navigation bar had been switched into a dropdown "hamburger" menu. But when clicking on the hamburger icon, the dropdown didn't drop down to show the menu options.
2. I solved this by adding an invisible checkbox that was layered above the hamburger icon. This way I could check for when the dropdown menu was clicked using the :checked selector in css. When the checkbox was checked I made the dropdown menu visible.

* During testing I also found an issue when viewing tablet devices. The problem was that I didn't get it correctly responsive for Ipad.
1. Using the inspector tool, I tested the page on a Ipad view. 
2. After looking for bugs in the Ipad view, I noticed that some of the different sections where meshed together.
3. Using media querys in the css, I made an exception for the existing margins when on a Ipad sized view.

# Code/Sources

## Content

Here i found how to put my text behind the background picture. I used "z-index" to solve this problem.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1093955/make-the-image-go-behind-the-text-and-keep-it-in-center-using-css

I used hexcolortool for all my colors in the page. 
I thought it was a very good and user-friendly tool for finding the right color.

I used stackoverflow a couple of times in my project, here i used it to find how i scroll to a specific element on my website.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24739126/scroll-to-a-specific-element-using-html

I thought this timeline fit perfectly on my website, so I used it. I changed the text to suit me and my experience. I also changed the color of it so that it would fit more in my page.

I used boostrap google map to get a map and shape for my page.

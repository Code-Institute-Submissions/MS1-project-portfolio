# Screenshots

This is a picture before my first mentor call my code were broken and things weren't were its supposed to be. 

1. At first i had a grayscale on my background pic whitch looks nicer whitout.
2. Several parts was "broken" in terms of alignment, mostly on mobile and tablets.
3. I had alot of problems with the navbar, it broke on mobile and tablets. 
4. In the beginning i didnÂ´t use boostrap so much and i became a problem further in the project.

This are pictures when im almost finished. 

1. First i choosed to have the background picture cover the whole front page. Then i took away the grayscale becuse it looks more nice without it.
2. I fixed the broken parts mostly the navbar so it fits mobile and tablets. I used media Querys to solve most problems with the navbar and profilepicture. then i started to use bootstraps "row" and "col" to solve the alignment issues i had on the page.

## Content

Here i found how to put my text behind the background picture. I used "z-index" to solve this problem.

I used hexcolortool for all my colors in the page. 
I thought it was a very good and user-friendly tool for finding the right color.

I used stackoverflow a couple of times in my project, here i used it to find how i scroll to a specific element on my website.

I thought this timeline fit perfectly on my website, so I used it. I changed the text to suit me and my experience. I also changed the color of it so that it would fit more in my page.

I used boostrap google map to get a map and shape for my page.

## Inspiration


I got a lot of inspiration from Apple's website as I wanted it very clean just like their website. I was also in other people's portfolios and checked a bit how they had done on their websites. but mostly it was to google around on pages I like and see how they did.
